## Purpose
This micro-architecture specification provides a comprehensive guide for implementing a production-ready I2C IP core. It is designed to enable RTL designers, from novices to experts, to create a fully functional design with configurability for various SoC classes. The specification covers all aspects necessary for SoC architects, software engineers, and system designers to integrate and utilize the IP effectively.

## Scope
This specification details the internal architecture, modules, state machines, timing, safety mechanisms, testing strategies, and integration guidelines for the I2C IP core. It assumes familiarity with basic digital design concepts and Verilog/SystemVerilog.

## Document Structure
This specification is organized into multiple documents for clarity and ease of navigation. Each document focuses on a specific aspect of the micro-architecture.

### Core Documents
1. **[Interface Details](interface_details.md)** - Pin-level descriptions, signal protocols, and timing diagrams
2. **[Module Specifications](module_specs.md)** - Internal modules, registers, and configurability options
3. **[State Machines](state_machines.md)** - Finite State Machine diagrams and descriptions for master/slave operations
4. **[Implementation Examples](implementation_examples.md)** - RTL code snippets, best practices, and design patterns

### Advanced Topics
5. **[Timing Specifications](timing_specs.md)** - Detailed timing parameters, constraints, and clock domain considerations
6. **[Safety Mechanisms](safety_mechanisms.md)** - Fault tolerance, automotive compliance, and error handling
7. **[Testing Guidelines](testing_guidelines.md)** - Verification strategies, testbenches, and coverage metrics
8. **[Integration Guide](integration_guide.md)** - SoC integration, software interfaces, and board design considerations
