# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for I2C IP Core

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an open-source, production-ready I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) IP core designed for use in micro-controllers, application processors, FPGAs, and ASICs. The IP provides a flexible, standards-compliant implementation of the I2C protocol.

## 2. Purpose

The I2C IP core enables seamless integration of I2C communication in digital designs, supporting both master and slave operations. It is intended for off-the-shelf use in embedded systems, IoT devices, and SoC designs requiring reliable serial communication.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- Verilog implementation of I2C master and slave functionality
- Configuration options for mode selection
- Compliance with I2C standards
- SoC fabric integration using ARM protocols
- FPGA and ASIC compatibility
- Open-source licensing and development environment

### Out of Scope
- Physical I/O buffers and pad cells
- Analog components (pull-up resistors, etc.)
- Non-digital logic implementations
- Hardware-specific optimizations beyond standard cells

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Functionality

- **FPGA Vendors**: Compatible with Xilinx, Intel/Altera, and Lattice FPGAs
- **EDA Tools**: Fully synthesizable with open-source tools (Yosys, OpenROAD) and commercial tools (Synopsys, Cadence)
- **Standards Compliance**: Adhere to I2C specifications from NXP/Philips and industry standards

### 5.3 Reliability
- **Robustness**: Handle bus contention, noise, and electrical disturbances
- **Testability**: Built-in self-test features and scan chain support

## 6. Interfaces

### 6.1 External Interfaces
- **I2C Bus**: SDA (bidirectional data) and SCL (clock) lines
- **Note**: IO buffers are external to the IP

### 6.2 Internal Interfaces
- **APB/AHB Bus**: For register access and control
- **Interrupt Lines**: For event signaling
- **Clock and Reset**: System clock and reset inputs
